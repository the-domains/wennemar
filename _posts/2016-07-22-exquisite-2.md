# Exquisite 2

_Exquisite 2_ is a reference to the [Exquisite Corpse][0] style invented by the beginning Surrealists in that the images are collectively assembled, but through objects around my home at various times and days while I am the only player drawing on unfolded paper.

My hand holds a nest with a dove's egg and a tiny umbrella while a columbine flower from our yard unfolds as a little bee lands on it in the wind with a maple leaf stretching veins similar to the lines of my hand.
